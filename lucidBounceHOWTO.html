OBJECTIVE

Lucid Bounce puts the fun of the arcade in the palm of your hand, without hiding the cool stuff under the hood.  This game uses our new LeoGamer to showcase what you can do with an LCD screen and joystick a few buttons and some Arduino code.  While the controller itself will amaze you, this tutorial is about the code that goes into the machine.   The objective is to write a bouncing ball and moving paddle game.  In the process, you'll learn a few useful things about interfacing with an analog joystick (part #), writing functions , and using a 3rd party library.  


SKILLS NEEDED:
-------------------
Basic Arduino coding ability is necessary for this tutorial.  It helps to understand the concept of modularity.   <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr05/cos126/lectures/14.pdf">This example pdf using java</a> from Princeton University shows a lot more aspects than we will use in our example.  But the idea of separating code into useful pieces will come in handy.  

SKILLS GAINED:
----------------
This program focuses on getting pictures drawn onto an LCD screen.  One of the most important ideas in the free software ecosystem is what the MIT hackers used to call "Bumming Code".  Basically we learn to use other peoples code to write our own.  As such, one skill we gain in this tutorial is how to use a third party library to get the pictures we want on the screen.  We can bum code for just about everything thanks to sites like  <a href="http://www.github.com">github</a> .  In fact, we could probably add github as a skill gained.  Although we won't go into it in great detail.
